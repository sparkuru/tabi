# Mandatory Preview Console Contract

- ownership: project-shared
- source: project-authored preview policy

## Scope

Read this reference before creating, adapting, or checking a project's
`preview.sh` or its underlying summary renderer. Every Trellis Plus preview
must use this output contract, regardless of framework, service names, Docker
wrapper, or Compose topology. Project-specific startup and readiness procedures
remain in the existing lifecycle; they do not authorize a different console
format. Record this contract and its address-discovery procedure in the
project-owned development spec so future tasks can enforce it without this
skill installed.

The purpose is to let the user click or copy a complete URL to open a testing
window, including from a different device. Put access URLs before listener and
runtime diagnostics. Never advertise `0.0.0.0`, `::`, a container IP, or a
Compose service name as a host-accessible browser destination.

## Required Output Template

Use the following `输出参考` code block as the mandatory output template. On
successful `start`, including an already-running healthy preview, print one
summary with these exact section labels and ordering. Omit empty sections.
Within `Open` and `Local only`, use `<entry label> (<service>):` followed by one
complete URL per line, without bullets, inline annotations, or trailing
punctuation. Keep service/entry ordering stable and deduplicate URLs within
each entry. `Website`, `Admin`, `API`, and `API docs` are standard entry labels
when those routes exist; additional entries use their actual user-facing name.

Published:
Published web: 0.0.0.0:7081 -> 0.0.0.0:80 (active listener)
Published web: 0.0.0.0:7082 -> container port 443 (no active listener)

Internal only:
API docs (api): http://api:8000/api/docs (Compose network only)
Internal probe: <actual project command that probes the internal API>

Notes:
Host addresses enumerated with ip -br a; access from other devices is unverified.
```

The example IPs are documentation addresses; substitute discovered runtime
values. Service topology, entries, routes, protocols, and ports vary; section
labels, entry syntax, ordering, and one-URL-per-line layout are mandatory.

- Use effective runtime schemes, host ports (including dynamically assigned
  ports), and routes. Reverse-proxy entries use the proxy service and published
  port. Include only real interfaces; do not invent `/admin` or `/api/docs`.
- `Listeners` covers all preview services' active listeners, including
  internal-only, non-browser, and container-loopback control endpoints. State
  scope and protocol. For a host-native service, use `host` as its scope.
- `Published` covers actual Docker host mappings. A mapping alone is not proof
  of a listener. Mark inactive or unverified mappings explicitly and omit their
  browser URLs. Do not present an uninspected listener as active or absent.
- `Internal only` holds container-network destinations and the actual existing
  access/probe command, with the right env file, project directory, Compose
  file, and service. Do not publish an internal service to populate `Open`.
- `Notes` holds applicable TLS/self-signed-certificate instructions, address
  discovery limitations, and cross-device verification results. Never print
  credentials, tokens, authenticated URLs, or raw environment contents.
- Capture routine wrapper command echoes, container IDs, framework banners,
  and Compose progress during startup; show them through an explicit verbose
  mode or on failure, redacting secrets. Successful default startup must use
  the summary above rather than a project-specific mixture of startup logs
  and access lines.

## Host Address Discovery

For wildcard host publishing, run `ip -br a` on the **host publishing the
preview**, on every `start` summary and every ready `status` summary. This is
required when the effective host bind is `0.0.0.0`; a container wildcard bind
alone does not establish host exposure.
For a remote Docker daemon, discover on that daemon host through an existing
authorized route. Never substitute addresses from the caller's machine or a
container network namespace. If that host cannot be inspected, report the
limitation and request explicit host-address configuration.

1. Parse each interface row as interface name, state, and **all** remaining
   address fields. Accept interfaces in `UP` or `UNKNOWN` state that have
   addresses; skip `DOWN` interfaces. Strip CIDR prefixes, validate address
   fields, and deduplicate addresses while preserving discovery order.
2. For an IPv4 host bind of `0.0.0.0`, enumerate every assigned non-loopback,
   non-unspecified IPv4 address from those rows. Do not select only the first
   interface, first address, default-route address, or a configured LAN hint.
   Include secondary addresses and bridge/VPN/tunnel addresses as candidates;
   discovery does not prove that another device can reach them. Do not label
   every candidate as a verified LAN address.
3. For each browser entry with an active host-accessible listener, generate
   `<scheme>://<discovered-host-address>:<effective-host-port><actual-path>`
   for **every** eligible address. Repeat the whole address list for each
   entry, grouped by service as in `Open`. A configured host/domain may add a
   valid candidate but must not replace wildcard-bind enumeration.
4. For a specific non-loopback host bind, advertise only that bound address
   and applicable configured names. For a loopback host bind, emit `Local only`
   and no remote candidates. Do not convert a container-only or loopback-only
   endpoint into host-interface URLs. Put reachable host loopback URLs in
   `Local only (preview host)`, never in `Open`.
5. IPv4 wildcard publishing does not establish IPv6 publishing. Enumerate
   non-loopback IPv6 addresses only for an effective IPv6 host mapping/bind;
   bracket IPv6 literals in URLs. Exclude link-local IPv6 addresses requiring a
   client-specific zone identifier and explain the omission in `Notes` when
   relevant. Do not assume `[::]` also accepts IPv4 without runtime evidence.
6. Check for `ip` before startup when wildcard address discovery is required.
   If missing or enumeration fails, return an actionable dependency/discovery
   error; never silently fall back to only `127.0.0.1` or a guessed IP. If
   enumeration succeeds but finds no eligible addresses, omit `Open` and state
   `No non-loopback host address found.` in `Notes`; retain valid local/internal
   access. Preserve host network configuration.

## Readiness And Verification

Print `System is ready.` only after **every required preview service** passes
its bounded readiness check. Container running state or a published port is
insufficient. A failed check must return nonzero, name the failing service,
and show actionable diagnostics, with no success banner or ready access list.
Transient failed polls may be logged in verbose mode; a terminal failure must
not be followed by a success summary. A ready `status` uses the same renderer;
an unready `status` reports actual service state without the success banner.

When changing a project's renderer, validate behavior with temporary address
and runtime fixtures before the normal lifecycle smoke check:

- Two host interfaces and multiple addresses on one row: every eligible IPv4
  URL appears for every entry, with the published host port rather than the
  container port; duplicates and CIDR suffixes never appear.
- `UP`, `UNKNOWN`, `DOWN`, loopback, bridge, and tunnel rows: eligible candidates
  are complete, local URLs are separated, and reachability is not overstated.
- IPv4 wildcard, specific-host, loopback-only, container-only, and IPv6 mappings:
  destinations respect actual exposure; no wildcard browser URL is printed.
- Missing/failing `ip`, no non-loopback addresses, HTTPS, and an inactive
  published port: errors/notes are accurate and unusable entries are omitted.
- One required service never becomes ready: nonzero exit, named diagnostics,
  no success banner. Repeated healthy starts and ready `status` keep the same
  summary layout without leaking startup logs or secrets.

Fixture checks do not prove physical-device reachability. Report host probes
and cross-device tests separately, and retain the unverified note until the
intended device/network access has actually been checked.

## Project verification entry

Run `bash infra/test-preview.sh` for temporary Compose/address fixtures.
The lifecycle loads `infra/preview-console.sh`; `status` probes owned services
and host publications before calling the same renderer as `start`.

Real-container checks must use isolated configuration, free ports and disposable
test data; preserve existing preview instances and user data. Fixture, container
readiness and physical-device access are separate claims.
